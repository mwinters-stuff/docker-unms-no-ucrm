# Docker image modification of https://github.com/Nico640/docker-unms without UCRM

Usage is the same as for https://github.com/Nico640/docker-unms but without UCRM

* Builds are for arm64 and amd64

## Usage
Initially start with the original version (Nico640/docker-unms), this will create the ucrm database, make sure you are all
running correctly then use the following image.

ghcr.io/mwinters-stuff/docker-unms-no-crm:latest

I will attempt to keep up-to-date with the latest from Nico640/docker-unms
